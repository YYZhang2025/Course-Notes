### Stanford CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch

[Course Link](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs336/) | [My Notes](https://yuyang.info/Course-Notes/posts/Gen-AI/stanford-cs336.html) | [My Solutions](https://github.com/YYZhang2025/Stanford-CS336)

In this course, we will learn how to build large language models from scratch. It includes the topics of, from bottom to top:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing (Lecture 14 & 14)
- Model Architecture and Variants (Lecture 3 & 4)
- GPU Training and Optimization (Lecture 5 & 6)
- Parallel and Distributed Training (Lecture 7 & 8)
- Speed up Inference (Lecture 10)
- Scaling Laws (Lecture 9 & 11)
- Evaluation and Benchmarking (Lecture 12)
- LLM Alignment (Lecture 15, 16 & 17)

But I think the most valuable part of this course is the assignments, which are designed to help you build a language model from scratch. The assignments include:

Which is time-consuming but very rewarding. You will learn how to:
